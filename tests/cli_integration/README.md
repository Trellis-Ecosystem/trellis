# CLI Integration Tests (#142)

Shell-based tests that drive the built `trellis` CLI binary against a real
Soroban RPC endpoint — a local devnet, not the Soroban sandbox the Rust unit
tests run in. This is the only layer that exercises the CLI's actual argument
formatting, JSON parsing, and error handling through the real `stellar
contract invoke` subprocess.

## Prerequisites

- Docker (or another engine `stellar container` supports)
- [`stellar` CLI](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tools/cli/install-cli) 26.x+ on `PATH`
- Rust with the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target:
  ```bash
  rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
  ```

## Running

```bash
bash tests/cli_integration/run.sh
```

The script is self-contained and idempotent:

1. Starts a local Soroban devnet container if one isn't already running
   (`stellar container start local`) and waits for it to report healthy.
2. Generates and funds `payer`/`payee`/`resolver` identities if they don't
   already exist.
3. Builds the `trellis` CLI (release) and the `trellis_core` contract
   (wasm32), then deploys a fresh contract instance and a native-XLM SAC test
   token.
4. Runs the full milestone lifecycle (init → lock-funds → submit-work →
   approve-release), the dispute path (raise-dispute → resolve-dispute), an
   unfunded-milestone cancellation, and key error paths (malformed
   agreement ID, double-init, wrong-signer, `--dry-run`) — asserting on the
   CLI's actual `--json` output.
5. Prints a pass/fail summary and exits non-zero if anything failed.

Each run generates fresh 64-hex-char agreement IDs (suffixed with a
timestamp) and deploys a new contract instance, so re-running against an
already-running container never collides with a previous run's state.

CI runs this automatically (`.github/workflows/contract-ci.yml`, job
`cli-integration`) on every push/PR touching `contracts/` or `cli/`, since it
only needs a local Docker container — no live testnet or credentials
required.
